# Build and Deploy an End-to-end Streaming NLP Insights System
Speaker: [Michal Mucha](https://github.com/MichaMucha)

## Description

At this workshop, you will build your own messaging insights system - data ingestion from a live data source (Reddit), queueing, deploying a machine learning model, and serving messages with insights to your mobile phone!

Come and build your portfolio - create a plug-and-play machine learning deployment.
Containerized, modular and easy to extend code, the foundation of your own NLP system!

## Abstract

Come and join this workshop if you want to go on a tour of applied engineering solutions. We will cover a lot of ground. You will get to try and experiment with methods used by successful experts to deliver functional results quickly - and make them your own! This is for data professionals who want to deliver comprehensive, wholesome solutions that are easy to put in production.

To make the most out of the session, download and prepare the required materials, come with a happy and focused attitude, and be ready to collaborate with other participants. The goal of this workshop is for everyone to feel empowered and confident in their practical knowledge of newly acquired methods. Have fun and meet other members of this great community!

Please follow the 5 quick steps in this walkthrough to have the necessary API keys and python packages installed for the workshop.

## What you will learn:

How to build an end to end NLP notification system in a streaming paradigm:

1. ingesting live message streams from sources such as reddit
2. storing the stream and organizing processing queues
3. wrapping up ML models as services for streaming ML predictions
4. publishing predictions and insights as messages through a messaging app bot

How to create and maintain easily reproducible conda environments
How to use docker-compose to neatly orchestrate and connect containerized services
How to ship your Python code in a versioned and modularized way. Make easy to use command line interfaces with Fire + secret tricks with setuptools
Use messaging queues and key spaces with Redis. Stream live insights to your phone using a Telegram bot.

## What you will bring home:

A plug-and-play, extendable streaming deployment for machine learning and ordinary services
Containerized, modular and easy to extend code
The beginning of your own NLP system!

It will be an honor to have you at the workshop!
